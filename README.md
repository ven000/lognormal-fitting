# lognormal-fitting

what is a lognormal distribution?
1. Suppose a normally distributed random variable X has mean mu and standard deviation sigma. Then Y = exp(X) is lognormally distributed with s = sigma and scale = exp(mu).
2. Suppose a lognormally distributed random variable X has scale = exp(mu) and standard deviation sigma. Then Y=log(X) is normally distributed with s = sigma and mean = mu.
